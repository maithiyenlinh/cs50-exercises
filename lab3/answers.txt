sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: the reversed-list still from the biggest to smallest, so we don't have the perfectlist in here,
I compare both random and reversed list, sort1 always give the time slower than sort3

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: in random-list, sort2 have the time smallest

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: sort3 have the time faster than sort1 in both case
